=============================================

* Follow along with our v7 embedding [video tutorial series here.]
* View the [live hosted demo here.]


Getting started
---------------
 
 > Follow these steps to load this demo locally onto your system
 
 - First install Jaspersoft v7. If needed, you can install the [60 day trial here.]
 
 - Download this github repo onto your local web server. Use any tool that you like (for example: [MAMP]) to host.
 
 - Build a new database in POSTGRES called "freshcoffee" (using pgAdmin you can right click Databases > create > database)
  
 - Now right click your "freshcoffee" database and select restore. Under Filename you can select your database file named "freshcoffee" under the resources/data folder in this repo. 
  
 - Your data should now be set! If you need them, you can also find the CSV data files under the resources/data folder and scripts to build the tables and add with the following in the terminal...
 - psql -c "COPY tbname FROM '/tmp/the_file.csv' delimiter '|' csv;"
 
 - Now import the jrs-urban-export.zip file from the resources/jrs-resources folder on this repo into the JasperReport Server by logging in as superuser and going to (admin > server settings > import).
 
 - You can also double check your database connection by going to the Jaspersoft Server, opening view > repository and navigating to public > samples > UrbanRoast > Data Sources. Now you can right click the "freshcoffee" data source and select edit to ensure that your Postgres username and password (default: postgres/postgres) is set. If your Postgres data port is different than the default you can change it here as well.
 
 - If you want to setup application on local, replace all the instances of https://mobiledemo.jaspersoft.com to your own local JRS instance(e.g. http://localhost:8080 ).
 
 - You can now run any of the main module pages, for example you can open the module3 folder and run cafe.html on your server. From there you can use the top right nav in the page to run any of the three finished modules.
 
 - Keep in mind that module1 is broken up into three parts as we build, with the module 1-3 and locations.html as the finished result.
 
 - Note: You'll want to make sure that all HTML files point to the location you have JRS installed for Visualize.js. 
	This is usually on localhost:8080 - "http://localhost:8080/jasperserver-pro/client/visualize.js"
